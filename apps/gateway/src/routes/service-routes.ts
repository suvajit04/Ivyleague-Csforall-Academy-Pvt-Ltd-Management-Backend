/**
 * Route table for the gateway.
 *
 * Each entry proxies a public path prefix through to the service that owns it.
 * `rewritePrefix` is kept identical to `prefix` because every service mounts its
 * routes under the same public path it is reached by (setGlobalPrefix('/api')
 * plus URI versioning), so no path translation is needed.
 *
 * Adding a service means adding entries here — nothing else in the gateway changes.
